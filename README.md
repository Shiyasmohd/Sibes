## Inspiration

Did you know that the amount of food produced in this world is enough to feed 1.5 times the total population of earth. but as many as 811 million people still go hungry every day . This means a huge amount of food is wasted which could have relieved many from hunger .

## What it does

Sibes is an app to help people to share their leftover food. Anyone can list their left food on this app which will be made available to the public. letting everyone know that. Thereby preventing them from going to waste baskets . The use cases of this app can vary . this can be used especially by restaurant or hotel owners to give away their good leftovers. It's often that much food is left behind from various events, like wedding parties, so Sibes can be used here too, We promote any food donations even if it its just one meal. Sibes can also be used by charitable foundations who are donating food. Also one more thing to note here is that food production also leads to massive amounts of pollution (up-to 40%). So reducing the food resource consumption will drastically reduce pollution . Agriculture used to be a silent killer in case of pollution, because everyone sees it as an eco-friendly activity , but deep down it causes much pollution .

## Technologies Used

‚Ä¢ Flutter <br/>
‚Ä¢ Firebase

## Challenges we ran into

Unfortunately I have disabled option for booking food in Sibes , this is due to the very reason that we built the app, to prevent food wastage. It follows first come first serve.

## What's next for Sibes

Sibes have a long path in front of it, to get more users we need more than just popularity , we need a community which are willing to help others. We are also planning to give digital points to restaurants and hotels who are donating more , this can be used by them for popularity or to showcase their donations .
